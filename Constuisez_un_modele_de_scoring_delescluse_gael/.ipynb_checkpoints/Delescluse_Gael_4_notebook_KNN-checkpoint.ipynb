    "## K-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "Le modèle K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) est un algorithme simple et intuitif utilisé en apprentissage automatique pour la classification et la régression. C'est un modèle qui prend des décisions en se basant sur les voisins les plus proches dans l'espace des données. Il est simple mais souvent efficace, particulièrement utile dans les cas où la structure des données est complexe et difficile à modéliser de manière analytique."

Cette prédiction est plus dangereuse pour la pertinence du modèle car si nous prédisons un remboursement probable d'un crédit et que cela n'est pas le cas, cela impacte directement la rentabilité de la banque, ce qui n'est pas souhaitable.
